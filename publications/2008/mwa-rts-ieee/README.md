The interferometric technique known as peeling addresses
many of the challenges faced when observing with low-frequency
radio arrays, and is a promising tool for the associated calibration
systems.We investigate a real-time peeling implementation
for next-generation radio interferometers such as the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA). TheMWA is being built in Australia and
will observe the radio sky between 80 and 300 MHz. The data rate
produced by the correlator is just over 19 GB/s (a few peta-bytes/
day). It is impractical to store data generated at this rate, and software
is currently being developed to calibrate and form images
in real time. The software will run on-site on a high-throughput
real-time computing cluster at several tera-flops, and a complete
cycle of calibration and imaging will be completed every 8 s. Various
properties of the implementation are investigated using simulated
data. The algorithm is seen to work in the presence of strong
galactic emission and with various ionospheric conditions. It is also
shown to scale well as the number of antennas increases, which
is essential for many upcoming instruments. Lessons from MWA
pipeline development and processing of simulated data may be applied
to future low-frequency fixed dipole arrays.
