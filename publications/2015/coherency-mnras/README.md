The Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation (RIME) is a matrix based mathematical
model that describes the response of a radio interferometer.  The Jones
calculus it employs is not suitable for describing the analogue components
of a telescope. This is as it does not consider the effect of impedance
mismatches between components.  This paper aims to highlight the limitations
of Jones calculus, and suggests some alternative methods that are
more applicable.

We reformulate the RIME with a different basis that includes magnetic and mixed coherency statistics. 
We present a microwave network inspired 2N-port version of the RIME, and a tensor formalism based upon
the electromagnetic tensor from special relativity.
We elucidate the limitations of the Jones-matrix-based RIME for describing analogue components. We show how
measured scattering parameters of analogue components can be used in a 2N-port version of the RIME. In addition, we 
show how motion at relativistic speed affects the observed flux.  
We present reformulations of the RIME that correctly account for magnetic field coherency. 
These reformulations extend the standard formulation and highlight its limitations.
