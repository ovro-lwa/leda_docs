\begin_layout Abstract
The FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format was developed in
 the late 1970s for storage and exchange of astronomy-related image data.
 Since then, it has become a standard file format not only for images, but
 also for radio interferometer data (e.g.
 UVFITS, FITS-IDI)
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
, and single dish data (e.g.
 MBFITS, SDFITS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 But is FITS the right format for next-generation telescopes to adopt? The
 newer Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5) file format offers considerable advantage
s over FITS, but has yet to gain widespread adoption within radio astronomy.
 One of the major holdbacks is that HDF5 is not well supported by data reduction
 software packages
\begin_inset Note Note

e, such as AIPS and MIRIAD and CASA (some existing support)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Here, we present a comparison of FITS, HDF5, and the MeasurementSet (MS)
 format for storage of interferometric data.
 In addition, we present a tool for converting between formats.
 We show that the underlying data model of FITS can be ported to HDF5, a
 first step toward achieving wider HDF5 support.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) data format is the most widespread
 standard for the storage and exchange of datasets within astronomy.
 Since its inception 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, FITS has enjoyed several decades of widespread usage.
 The success of FITS has been attributed in part to the guiding maxim

: that changes to the standard must be incremental and must not break backward
 compability

 and does not fundamentally change the nature of the format
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 For this reason, it is familiar to many generations of astronomers,
\begin_inset Note Note

, and is supported by myriad software packages.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a large ecosystem of software 
\begin_inset Note Note

\end_layout

\end_inset

 has in turn motivated further adoption of the standard.

 for the reading and writing of FITS files has become the

\begin_layout Standard
FITS has necessarily evolved over the years, with the addition of features
 such as random groups

, tables

; FITS is now officially at version 3.0 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 However, these changes have been relatively minor iterations upon the core
 FITS format.

 new data storage concepts and methods provide many advantages that cannot
 be leveraged without a drastic overhaul of the FITS standard, or migration
 to a new standard.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The limitiations of FITS have been previously acknowledged and documented,
 for example in

 considered HDF4 as a format.
 Here, we consider the immediate, practicable advantages of HDF5 (Hierarchical
 Data Format) as a data storage format for visibility data.
 We show that data in FITS format can be converted in a straightforward
 fashion to HDF5 format, and that conventions for the storage of visibility
 data can be ported to HDF5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to discuss data storage methods and file formats without ambiguity,
 we first need to clarify our vocabulary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data model:
\emph default
 a high-level, conceptual model of data, types of data, and how data are
 organized, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 and

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Data schema: 
\emph default
a lower-level, domain-specific ontology (i.e.
 framework that gives meaning) of how data and metadata are arranged inside
 a data model.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, a schema may define a set of rules for the names of attributes
 and datasets, and how data are organized within the data model.

\emph on
Storage model:

 how objects from the data model are mapped to bytes within an address space
 on storage media

 of users.
\end_layout

 Both these formats store not only the visiblility data, but also metadata
 such as antenna positions, information on observation setup, and calibration
 tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Visibility data can be expressed as a multidimensional array, often referred
 to as a 'visibility matrix'.
 This matrix has axes corresponding to integration number, baseline, frequency
 channel, and the corresponding complex visibility (more complex observations
 may require more axes).

, to acommodate multiple phase centers and/or frequency setups.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two visibility data conventions share many keywords and unit definitions,
 but their schema and underlying storage models differ.
 In UVFITS, the visibility data are stored in a random group HDU (header
 data unit), whereas in FITS-IDI data are stored in a binary table HDU.
 In both formats, each row of the table contains columns for the timestamp
 and a baseline identifier, along with the multidimensional visibility array
 for that timestamp and baseline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
CASA MeasurementSets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative file format for visibility data is the MeasurementSet (MS;
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Kemball:2001um"

\end_inset

).
 This format is used by the CASA reduction package (ascl:1107.013) and related
 software
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
, for which defacto file I/O API is given by the casacore library
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The storage model for the MS format is a directory consisting of several
 data files nested inside child directories.
 Unlike FITS and HDF5, MS has no in-built data compression capability.
 Visibility data are stored in the MAIN table; this also provides keys to
 the various subtables that provide instrument and observation metadata.
 The MS standard defines data schema for images, visibility data and single-dish
 data.
 The MS data model differ significantly to FITS, meaning that conversion
 requires a non-trivial mapping.
 For example, MS files have no equivalent to the FITS HDU, and while FITS-IDI
 assigns an integer ID for every baseline, MS uses a pair of antenna IDs.

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations of the FITS format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since the conception of FITS, astronomical datasets and their corresponding
 processing requirements have grown by many orders of magnitude.
 As a point of reference, the world's first gigabyte-capacity hard drive
 -- the IBM 3380 -- weighed 249 kg and was the size of a refrigerator; this
 was released in 1980.
 Modern-day telescopes can produce this amount of data in under a second.
 
\end_layout

There are three key questions that must be addressed:

HDF5 for visibility storage

There are several advantages of the HDF5 format over both FITS and MS, the
 most compelling of these are improvements to the storage model that are
 beneficial for large datasets.
 For example, HDF5 provides parallel and network I/O, data chunking methods,
 external (i.e.
 distributed) object storage, and a filter pipeline for data compression.
 Of specific interest for visibility data is

 The hierarchical nature of HDF5 allows the header unit and

By porting the FITS and MS data models to HDF5, we may begin to leverage

 Doing so maintains familiarity to users and allows conversion back into

 This also limits the amount of modification required for existing programs
 to read, write and understand HDF5-stored data.
